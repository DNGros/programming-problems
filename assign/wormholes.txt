Description:

In a galaxy a far distance away a long long time ago, the residents of Planet 1
have just mastered the power of wormholes. A wormhole can transport people
across vast distances, but can trap the participants for some time. Due to the
flux-y nature of wormholes, it's also possible that a person can be sent back
in time. Alien president Eisenhower wants to convince the people to use
wormholes, and to do so, he's asked you to tell him how long it takes to get
from planet 1 to all other planets.

Note that in the current state of affairs, wormholes only work one way. In some
cases, one can always arrive at a planet at an arbitrarily early time. If
that's the case, visitors could be eaten by that planet's equivalent of
dinosaurs! It's important to look out for that case.

Rules:

Each input file will begin with a single line T, the total number of test
cases. Each test case consists of two space separated integers, P and W, the
number of planets and wormholes respectively. Then W lines follow, each
representing a single wormhole. Those lines have three space separated
integers, U, V, and S. This means that a wormhole connects planets U and V and
takes time S.

Output:

For each test case, print N space-separated integers on a single line, the
distance to each other planet. If it's impossible to reach a particular planet,
print "OUT" for that specific planet. If at least one planet can be arrived at
arbitrarily early, instead print "UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED" for the whole test case.

Constraints:

1 <= P <= 200
1 <= W <= P * (P - 1)
1 <= U, V <= P
-1000 <= S <= 1000

Input (read from standard in):

1 2 5
1 3 6
6 9
1 2 4
1 3 -3
1 6 19
3 5 -5

5 4 2
3 4 1
4 2 2

Output (print to standard out):
0 5 6
0 -4 -3 -6 -8 -2

Explanation:
In the first test case, there's just two direct wormholes to planets 2 and 3.
In the second test case, it's possible to get to every planet in negative time.
