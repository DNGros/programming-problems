Description:

Did you know that one of the most common interview questions is Fizz buzz
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)? This question typically acts as a
weed out question to determine which interviewees know basic programming. We
changed it up a bit, so this is our variant of Fizz buzz for competitive
programming! ...will you be weeded out?

Rules:

You're going to be given several pairs of integers a and b. For every x between
a and b (both inclusive) do the following:

1. If x is divisible by 3, add x + 3
2. If x is divisible by 5, add x + 5
3. If x is divisible by 3 and 5, add x^2

If rule 3 applies, don't perform rules 1 and 2.

After all integers have been added, print the sum on its own line.

Constraints:
1 <= a <= b <= 10^6

Input (read from standard in):

1 5
13 17
12 17

Output (write to standard out):

16
225
240
